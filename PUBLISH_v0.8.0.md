## Next Step: Upload to PyPI

Since this is a non-interactive environment, you need to upload manually. Here are two options:

### Option 1: Using PyPI API Token (Recommended)

```bash
# Set your PyPI API token as environment variable
export TWINE_PASSWORD="pypi-YourTokenHere"
export TWINE_USERNAME="__token__"

# Upload to PyPI
python3 -m twine upload dist/clustertk-0.8.0*
```

### Option 2: Using .pypirc file

Create `~/.pypirc` file:

```ini
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-YourTokenHere
```

Then upload:

```bash
python3 -m twine upload dist/clustertk-0.8.0*
```

### Option 3: Upload via PyPI Web Interface

1. Go to https://pypi.org/
2. Log in to your account
3. Click "Your projects" → "clustertk" → "Manage" → "Releases"
4. Click "Upload release"
5. Upload both files:
   - `dist/clustertk-0.8.0.tar.gz`
   - `dist/clustertk-0.8.0-py3-none-any.whl`

## After Publishing

1. Verify the package on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/clustertk/
2. Test installation: `pip install clustertk==0.8.0`
3. Test with extras: `pip install clustertk[extras]==0.8.0`
4. Update GitHub release with PyPI link

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check package metadata
python3 -m twine check dist/clustertk-0.8.0*

# Test in clean environment
python3 -m venv test_env
source test_env/bin/activate
pip install dist/clustertk-0.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
python -c "import clustertk; print(clustertk.__version__)"
deactivate
```
